    <p>For question 7, I originally put my returns inside of the loop. I got a functions
    that only returned true if the first value was matched, so I made the truthCheck variable
    as a placeholder while the loop was running. Was there a way I could have done this
    with just the first conditional and leaving my returns inside the loop code? </p>
